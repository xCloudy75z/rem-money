## Post-V1 features shipped

| Date | Feature | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-10 | **Credit (liability) tracker** | Tag spends "on credit"; new Credit tab tracks total owed across cycles with per-item + bulk "Paid" settlement. Additive fields (`isCredit`/`liabilitySettled`/`settledAt`), back-filled by migrate, no schema bump. Commit `e2164eb`. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). |

## Deploy state

- **Production URL:** https://xcloudy75z.github.io/rem-money/ (GitHub Pages)
- **Repo:** https://github.com/xCloudy75z/rem-money — this `v2/` folder **is** the repo root.
- **Pipeline:** push to `main` → GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) runs test + lint + build, publishes `dist/` to Pages. Pages source = "GitHub Actions".
- **Build artifact:** `dist/index.html` (~130 KB) + `dist/sw.js` (2.0 KB) — built by CI, **not** committed (gitignored).
- **Local dev URL:** http://localhost:5173 (via `npm run dev`)

## Open items (V2 / deferred — not blocking V1 ship)

| ID | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| infra | Pages actions on Node 20 | Forced to Node 24 via env var; will self-resolve when GitHub ships Node 24 builds of configure-pages/deploy-pages (or by June 2026 default) |
| V1 | Arabic UI | Harness in place (STRINGS.ar stub, RTL-ready CSS) |
| V2 | Per-category soft budgets | Schema-additive |
| V3 | Trend chart / sparkline | Pure SVG, no library |
| V5 | Transaction search | History tab `/`-key |
| V10 | Desktop keyboard shortcuts | `N` open entry, `,` settings |
| polish | Bundle size > 80KB target (currently 109KB) | Acceptable for one user; gzip will compress |

## Decisions locked

| Decision | Value | Date |
|---|---|---|
| Daily limit math: today included in divisor | Day 1 of 31-day cycle, AED 12,454.70 → **401.76 AED/day** | 2026-05-30 |
| Storage key | `spending-tracker:v1` (single key, version inside payload) | 2026-05-30 |
| Cycle pattern | 25th → 24th of next month (lock from FinanceOS pay-cycle convention) | 2026-05-30 |
| Pace deadband | ±3% | 2026-05-30 |
| MVP categories | Food / Transport / Bills / Fun / Other | 2026-05-30 |
| Theme default | `system` (follows OS) | 2026-05-30 |
| Container width | 440px max, same shell mobile + desktop | 2026-05-30 |
| Desktop chrome | Phone-frame at ≥900px viewport | 2026-05-30 |
| Backup envelope | `{app, schemaVersion, exportedAt, state}` | 2026-05-30 |
| Restore safety | Auto-snapshot to `lastAutoBackup` + 30s UNDO | 2026-05-30 |
| Timestamps stored as **local wall-clock** ISO (not UTC) | `createdAt`/`updatedAt` use local time so displayed times match the device clock | 2026-06-08 |
| One-time UTC→local migration, gated by `settings.localTimestamps` | Converts pre-existing UTC timestamps once, never double-shifts | 2026-06-08 |
| Deploy via GitHub Pages CI (dropped Netlify) | `git push` → Actions build + deploy | 2026-06-08 |
| Credit tracking is additive, no schema bump | `isCredit`/`liabilitySettled`/`settledAt` back-filled by migrate; old backups load cleanly | 2026-06-10 |
| Credit spends still count toward budget/pace | "On credit" only adds a liability total; it does not exclude the spend from the daily limit | 2026-06-10 |
