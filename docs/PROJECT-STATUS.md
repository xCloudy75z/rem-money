## Post-V1 features shipped

| Date | Feature | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-10 | **Credit (liability) tracker** | Tag spends "on credit"; new Credit tab tracks total owed across cycles with per-item + bulk "Paid" settlement. Additive fields (`isCredit`/`liabilitySettled`/`settledAt`), back-filled by migrate, no schema bump. Commit `e2164eb`. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). |
| 2026-06-12 | **Wife reimbursement tracker** | Tag spends `byWife` (forced on-credit + out-of-pace); new top-level `wifePayments` ledger; `Calc.wifeSummary` derives her `charged − paid` balance. "Wife owes you" card on the Credit tab with lump-sum + per-item "She paid" reimbursements. Additive, no schema bump, back-filled by migrate. 176 → 264 tests. Commits `9d39738`…`4060475`, deployed live via CI. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). |
| 2026-06-26 | **Per-category budgets + Planning page** | Categories gain `budget`/`budgetPeriod` (`monthly`/`yearly`); new **Plan** tab (4th) lists categories with spent-this-cycle progress bars + a Monthly/Annual ×12 toggle; `Calc.monthlyBudget`/`categorySpentThisCycle`/`planSummary` (pure). Planning-only — daily limit/pace untouched. Category management consolidated onto the Plan page; Settings keeps a shortcut. Additive, no schema bump, back-filled by migrate. 264 → 278 tests. Merge `a01296a`, deployed live via CI. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). |
| 2026-06-26 | **Unallocated readout · Refresh button · X-button fix** | Plan page gains an "Unallocated" pinned row + card line (`cycleBudget − totalPlanned`, red when over-allocated); `planSummary` returns `cycleBudget`/`unallocated`. Settings → App **Refresh app** button clears the cached shell + updates the SW + reloads (data kept). Fixed a pre-existing bug where the sheet **×** icon swallowed the close click (now matches nearest `[data-close]`). 278 → 280 tests. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). |

## Deploy state

- **Production URL:** https://xcloudy75z.github.io/rem-money/ (GitHub Pages)
- **Repo:** https://github.com/xCloudy75z/rem-money — this `v2/` folder **is** the repo root.
- **Pipeline:** push to `main` → GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) runs test + lint + build, publishes `dist/` to Pages. Pages source = "GitHub Actions".
- **Build artifact:** `dist/index.html` (~130 KB) + `dist/sw.js` (2.0 KB) — built by CI, **not** committed (gitignored).
- **Local dev URL:** http://localhost:5173 (via `npm run dev`)

## Open items (V2 / deferred — not blocking V1 ship)

| ID | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| infra | Pages actions on Node 20 | Forced to Node 24 via env var; will self-resolve when GitHub ships Node 24 builds of configure-pages/deploy-pages (or by June 2026 default) |
| V1 | Arabic UI | Harness in place (STRINGS.ar stub, RTL-ready CSS) |
| V2 | Per-category soft budgets | Schema-additive |
| V3 | Trend chart / sparkline | Pure SVG, no library |
| V5 | Transaction search | History tab `/`-key |
| V10 | Desktop keyboard shortcuts | `N` open entry, `,` settings |
| polish | Bundle size > 80KB target (currently 109KB) | Acceptable for one user; gzip will compress |

## Decisions locked

| Decision | Value | Date |
|---|---|---|
| Daily limit math: today included in divisor | Day 1 of 31-day cycle, AED 12,454.70 → **401.76 AED/day** | 2026-05-30 |
| Storage key | `spending-tracker:v1` (single key, version inside payload) | 2026-05-30 |
| Cycle pattern | 25th → 24th of next month (lock from FinanceOS pay-cycle convention) | 2026-05-30 |
| Pace deadband | ±3% | 2026-05-30 |
| MVP categories | Food / Transport / Bills / Fun / Other | 2026-05-30 |
| Theme default | `system` (follows OS) | 2026-05-30 |
| Container width | 440px max, same shell mobile + desktop | 2026-05-30 |
| Desktop chrome | Phone-frame at ≥900px viewport | 2026-05-30 |
| Backup envelope | `{app, schemaVersion, exportedAt, state}` | 2026-05-30 |
| Restore safety | Auto-snapshot to `lastAutoBackup` + 30s UNDO | 2026-05-30 |
| Timestamps stored as **local wall-clock** ISO (not UTC) | `createdAt`/`updatedAt` use local time so displayed times match the device clock | 2026-06-08 |
| One-time UTC→local migration, gated by `settings.localTimestamps` | Converts pre-existing UTC timestamps once, never double-shifts | 2026-06-08 |
| Deploy via GitHub Pages CI (dropped Netlify) | `git push` → Actions build + deploy | 2026-06-08 |
| Credit tracking is additive, no schema bump | `isCredit`/`liabilitySettled`/`settledAt` back-filled by migrate; old backups load cleanly | 2026-06-10 |
| Credit spends still count toward budget/pace | "On credit" only adds a liability total; it does not exclude the spend from the daily limit | 2026-06-10 |
| Wife spends excluded from pace, counted in bank-credit | `byWife` forces `isExcludedFromPace`+`isCredit`; stays out of your daily limit but counts toward what you owe the bank | 2026-06-12 |
| Wife reimbursement is an aggregate balance | `charged − paid` (no per-item settled flag); "She paid" just pre-fills a `wifePayment` amount | 2026-06-12 |
| Category budgets are a planning-only overlay | `budget`/`budgetPeriod` on categories; the Plan page shows spent-vs-budget but never affects the daily limit or pace | 2026-06-26 |
| Budgets stored in their native period; toggle is display-only | `budgetPeriod` `monthly`/`yearly`; `Calc.monthlyBudget` ÷12 for yearly; the Monthly/Annual toggle is pure ×12 display | 2026-06-26 |
| Per-category spend counts the cycle, includes byWife/credit | `categorySpentThisCycle` is signed and unfiltered — answers "what did this category cost," not "what counts toward pace" | 2026-06-26 |
| Category management lives on the Plan page | Add/edit/delete/reassign + budget consolidated there; Settings → Categories is a shortcut | 2026-06-26 |
